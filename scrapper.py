    # Comprehensive prompt to guide extraction of all car models
    extraction_prompt = """
    You are an expert automotive data extractor. Your task is to comprehensively extract detailed information about ALL car models from this specific brand/company page on cardekho.com.

    BRAND-SPECIFIC EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. This is a company/brand specific page (e.g., Tesla, Tata, Maruti, Hyundai, etc.)
    2. Extract ALL car models listed for this specific brand (could be 1 model like Tesla or 10+ models like Maruti)
    3. For EACH individual car model found on the page:
       - Click through or extract from the individual car details
       - Get complete specifications and pricing information
       - Extract all available variants (some cars have XE, XM, XT, XZ variants, others may have different naming)
    4. Focus on 2025 model year cars if specified, otherwise extract available models
    5. Look for detailed specifications sections for each model
    6. Extract exact pricing for each model/variant

    WHAT TO EXTRACT FROM EACH CAR ON THIS BRAND PAGE:
    For every car model visible (like Tesla Model Y, Tata Tiago, etc.):
    - Model name (e.g., "Model Y", "Tiago", "Nexon")
    - All variants of that model (if any)
    - Exact pricing (ex-showroom prices like ‚Çπ59.89 - 73.89 Lakh)
    - Engine/Motor specifications:
      * Engine displacement (cc) or Motor power for electric cars
      * Power output (bhp like 295 bhp)
      * Torque (Nm)
      * Range (km for electric cars like 622 km)
    - Fuel/Energy details:
      * Fuel type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG/Electric)
      * Fuel efficiency (kmpl) or Range (km for electric)
    - Vehicle specifications:
      * Body type (Sedan/SUV/Hatchback like Tesla Model Y is an SUV)
      * Seating capacity (like 5 Seats)
      * Transmission type
    - Safety ratings (if available)
    - Key features and highlights

    INDIVIDUAL CAR PROCESSING:
    - Process each car model separately and thoroughly
    - Look for specification tables, price details, feature lists for each model
    - Some brands like Tesla may have only 1 model, others like Maruti may have 10+ models
    - Extract complete information for each model found
    - Look for "View Offers", "View Details", "Specifications" sections for each car

    COVERAGE APPROACH:
    - Start with the main brand page overview
    - Identify all available models for this brand
    - Go through each model individually to extract complete details
    - Handle both simple pages (like Tesla with 1 model) and complex pages (like Maruti with many models)
    - Ensure no model is missed from the brand's lineup

    For the given example: Tesla page should extract complete details for Model Y including its ‚Çπ59.89 - 73.89 Lakh price, 622 km range, 295 bhp power, 5-seat capacity, electric fuel type, etc.
